## Introduction
PhotoFootprint is a photo based social media platform for travellers. It's core goal is to help bring awareness to Eco friendly methods of transportation, allowing the community to share their own experiences easily and simply on the application. User's can upload posts which can be liked, bookmarked (saved) and commented on. User's can follow other user's to stay upto date with their friends and favourite travellers. You can see the live website [here](https://photofootprint-combined-63d886cb4a04.herokuapp.com/)
## Contents
The README is split into 9 different parts - Overall Project Goals, Frontend, Backend, Testing, Deployment, Frontend Credits, Backend Credits, Acknowledgements and Overall Learning Outcomes.

# Overall Project Goals <a name="overall"></a>
PhotoFootprint's overall goal is to help bring awareness to Eco friendly methods of transportation, allowing the community to share their own experiences easily and simply on the application. User's can upload posts which can be liked, bookmarked (saved) and commented on. User's can follow other user's to stay upto date with their friends and favourite travellers. The application will have a fully CRUD functional API with frontend that serves the API JSON data in a user friendly manner.
# Frontend <a name="frontend"></a>
The frontend of this project is a React JS application. The following subsections are all of the Design, Features & Credits of the frontend part of this project.
## Design <a name="design"></a>
### Agile <a name="agile"></a>
I approached this project with an agile philosophy, applying the tools that GitHub offers to support this project. I set up a [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6), alongwith [Milestones](https://github.com/AlfredA93/pf-api/milestones) to help categorise the parts of the application that needed fulfilling. I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the User Stories and Tasks needed to be fulfilled. For the frontend I implemented User Stories which are referenced [below.](#user-stories)

- GitHub Milestones

### Project Goal <a name="project-fe"></a>
The goal within the frontend part of this project is to create a frontend React application that enables users to share content within a photobased social media platform. The platform should request and respond to the backend API handling the JSON data it receives which is then presented in a user friendly manner. Users can add/edit and/or delete posts, comments, likes, bookmarks. Users can create and edit their account. Users can also fill in a form to contact the PhotoFootprint Team through simple form.

### Scope <a name="scope-fe"></a>
Our scope for this project is small and aims to cover the basic functionality of what a social media application needs, this is due to having a short timeframe to meet the deadline for this project. The project would be further developed upon post-production. 

The whole project needed to be fulfilled within 19 days, therefore the API would need to be finished within 5-6 days (realistically), to allow more time spent on the frontend React app (8-9 days), allowing a minimum of 3-4 days for README documentation to be fulfilled at the end. We needed to be flexible with the needs of the project due to the set deadline, which was why I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the tasks set out in the PhotoFootprint GitHub Project. This meant that we had the core functionality of what we needed, but also allowed us to be flexible and address any bugs or errors if/when they arose. Here is a link to the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6) and [PhotoFootprint Milestones](https://github.com/AlfredA93/pf-api/milestones).

### Structure <a name="structure-fe"></a>
React is based on components. So within the display view, many components can make up the whole. See the [Features](#features) section for screenshots of the below components in action, alongwith the wireframe for a simple sketch of how they look.
- Navigation Bar - This will feature throughout the entire site, staying consistent for the user.
- Most Followed Accounts - Most Followed Accounts section will appear on every page (except the add/edit post page), below the navbar (on mobile/small screen devices) or to the right of the post(s) (on larger screens/desktops).
- Post (when in Discover, Feed and Profile pages) - Each post will appear displaying the Image, Title, Travel Type and Summary, alongwith the Like icon and count, Comment Icon and count and the Bookmark Icon to save the bookmark. It will not display the main content of the post. On the Feed and Discover pages, the page has an Infinite Scroll feature that means more posts can be loaded without pagination (only if there are more than 10 posts on a page). ***This is a reuseable component, in order to keep the code DRY ('don't repeat yourself'). It's used in Post Individual, Discover, Feed and Profile pages***
- Post (once clicked into the post or clicking on the comment button) - Within the individual post page, the Post will now include the main content of the post, where the owner of the post can write more content for their post.
- Comments - The comments section only appears on the individual post page, where users can now interact with the post and share their views with the owner of the post publically. This has Infinite Scroll, which loads older comments as you scroll down (only if there are more than 10 comments on a post).
- Edit Post Dropdown - This dropdown menu will display on each post where there are current logged in user is the owner of the post on screen.
- Edit Profile Dropdown - This dropdown menu allows the user to edit the profile details (username, password & bio) only if the current logged in user is the owner of the profile in view.
- Contact Us - This component is a button which enables a Modal to appear on screen when clicked. This allows the user to contact the PhotoFootprint Team if there is any questions, queries or feedback about the website. This is shown only if the current logged in user is the owner of the profile in view.
- Add/Edit Post - This is a standalone page where users can add or edit their posts. The Edit post page will automatically fill the fields with the current post data to be editted, for each of use.

### Design Choices
#### Colors
- I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%2300A000&sub=1) to help with color palette design. With the standout colors listed below. I chose to use Green as this is the colour societally associated with being friendly to the environment. The blues came in also as a reference to the blue sky and deep blue sea.
  - #00A000 Green
  - #3F4A3C Dark Grey with Green Hint
  - #00A847 Green
  - #14648D Pastel Blue
  - #F6EDD9 Cream
  - #00A6F3 Deep Sky Blue

![ColorSpace](/documentation/frontend-imgs/design-colour.webp)

#### Typography

The font [*Assistant*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Assistant) from GoogleFonts felt like the front that best matched the ethos of the [Overall Project Goals](#overall).

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- Navigation Bar. This allows the user to navigate consistently throughout the site. The Nav Bar will show two different sets of icons depending on whether the user is logged in or logged out. 
  - When the user is logged in, the following icons will show:
      - Add (add a post)
      - Discover (see all posts uploaded, with most recent appearing first)
      - Feed (see the posts from users that I follow)
      - Saved (see posts that I have bookmarked)
      - Log Out
      - Profile (see all of my posts in one place, and also where I can edit my profile)
  - ![navbar logged in](/documentation/frontend-imgs/navbar-loggedin.webp)
  - When the user is logged out, the following icons will show:
      - Discover
      - Sign In
      - Sign Up
  - ![navbar logged out](/documentation/frontend-imgs/navbar-loggedout.webp)
    - If the user is using a mobile or samall screened device, a burger menu will show
  - ![navbar burger](/documentation/frontend-imgs/navbar-burger.webp)
- Discover Page (Home Page) - This is where all the posts can be seen and searched through. This is where users can discover new places, new posts, new users, new people to follow and be inspired by, and maybe even inspire! It has Infinite Scroll, so users can easily and simply scroll through posts without having to deal with pagination or page refreshes. Users can only see the basic data from the post, the Image, Title, Summary, Comment count, Like count and Travel Type. They cannot see the Content of the post.
  - ![discover page](/documentation/frontend-imgs/discover-page.webp)
- Feed - This is where the users can see all the posts from the user's they follow. It has all the same features of the Discover Page, but is filtered by the profiles that you follow. Users can only see the basic data from the post, the Image, Title, Summary, Comment count, Like count and Travel Type. They cannot see the Content of the post.
  - ![search feed](/documentation/frontend-imgs/feed-page.webp)
- Search Bar - The search bar features on the Discover, Feed, and Saved pages. Users can search through all the posts within the current page environment(ie. Discover, Feed or Saved Page) by Title, Travel type and author/owner.

- Saved (Bookmarked) - This page will show all of the posts that the user has saved for future viewing. I felt it important to differentiate between likes and bookmarks, as not everyone post that you like, you want to save for later. Where as with bookmarks, you can save the posts you really love for later. Users can only see the basic data from the post, the Image, Title, Summary, Comment count, Like count and Travel Type. They cannot see the Content of the post.
  - ![saved page](/documentation/frontend-imgs/saved.webp)
- Post (individual page) - On this page, users can see the full content of the post, including the Content text of the post, this feature, alongwith commenting, sets this page apart from the Discover, Feed and Saved Pages. As aforementioned, users can comment on posts on this page.

# Backend - PhotoFootprint API <a name="backend"></a>
The backend of this project is a Django REST API application. The following subsections are all of the Design, Features & Credits of the backend part of this project.
## Design (backend) <a name="design-be"></a>
### Agile (backend) <a name="agile-be"></a>
To manage the tasks and user stories on this project I used GitHub Projects. For the backend I wrote Milestones for each app, with issues (tasks) to be completed within each milestone, which could then be 'closed' when each was completed. Here is a link to the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6) and [PhotoFootprint Milestones](https://github.com/AlfredA93/pf-api/milestones)
- The picture below is during the API phase of completion, when the Front End User Stories were yet to be added to the Project.
  - ![Agile Project](documentation/backend-imgs/agile-project.webp)

### Project Goal (backend) <a name="goals-be"></a>
The goal of the backend API is to create a fully functional API which supplies data for a frontend react app. The admins will be able to post, update and delete posts/comments/likes/bookmarks and follows within the development environment of the API (when debug is set to True). Outside of the development environment, Users will be able to do the same from the frontend react app accessing the API which serves JSON data directly to the frontend.

### Scope (backend) <a name="scope-be"></a>
Our scope for this project is small and aims to cover the basic functionality of what a social media application needs, this is due to having a short timeframe to meet the deadline for this project. The project would be further developed upon post-production. 

The whole project needs to be fulfilled within 19 days, therefore the API would need to be finished within 5-6 days (realistically), to allow more time spent on the frontend React app (8-9 days), allowing a minimum of 3-4 days for README documentation to be fulfilled at the end. We needed to be flexible with the needs of the project due to the set deadline, which was why I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the tasks set out in the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6). This meant that we had the core functionality of what we needed, but also allowed us to be flexible and address any bugs or errors if/when they arose.

The API will have appropriate apps to fulfil the following tasks:
- CRUD functionality on Posts **(Must Have)**
- CRUD functionality on Comments **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Likes **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Followers **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Bookmarks **(Should Have)**
- Create functionality on Contact Us form. **(Could Have)**

### Structure (backend) <a name="structure-be"></a>
The structure of the API needed to be organised, so we could make sure that all the relationships between the models could be mapped before coding. Below in the [ERD](#erd) section, you can see the relationships between the models with the arrows.

- Post Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - title - max length 100 characters
    - summary - max length 250 characters
    - content - text field
    - image - image field, default post image if user doesn't add image
    - travel - choice of 9 travels types: bicycle, boat, by foot, car, electric car, multiple, other, plane, train
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field
- Profile Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field
    - name - max length 250 characters
    - bio - text field
    - image - image field, default post image if user doesn't add image
- Comment Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - post (Foreign Key - from Post Model)
    - content - text field
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field

### Future Features <a name="be-future"></a>
- Add a maps app and map model for setting post coordinates, so that users can store their journey's and share them on each post.
- Enable video and larger files to be uploaded.
- Enhanced filtering of the content within the admin panel.

## Deployment <a name="deploy"></a>

This project was deployed to Heroku. To prepare the backend for this we need to do the following.
- Create a `Procfile` at the top most directory of the code - this will be used my Heroku command line to know what to do with the code once the application is built. In this file the code below should be written on seperate lines
  - `release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
  - `web: gunicorn photofootapi.wsgi`
- Create a `requirements.txt` file. The easiest way to do this is once your code is ready for deployment type in the command when under the root directory `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and all the Python libraries will be added to the requirements.txt file, ready for Heroku to install all the dependancies.
- Create a runtime.txt file - This is used by Heroku to determine which version of Python to use to run the libraries within your application. Check the heroku support documentation to see which Python versions are still supported [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#specifying-a-python-version). I chose this version - `python-3.11.5`
- Build a production ready application in the IDE before deployment, so Heroku can deploy this will greater ease. Under the root directory, add a new `staticfiles` folder. Making sure to keep it case sensitive to `staticfiles`. Once this has been done. Type in the command `python manage.py collectstatic`. This will compile all the static files from the backend to the staticfolder. Now change directory into the frontend folder - `cd frontend` and type this code `npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.` This will build the react application and place all the necessary build files into a build folder and then move it into the staticfiles folder we previously created. If you need to make any future changes post deployment, use this following command to make changes to the latest build - `npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.` 
- **Before deploying your production ready application you must set DEBUG = False within your IDE, so the site works as intended with any 404 pages working correctly. Once this change has been made, you can `push` the changes to your GitHub Repository** 
- Set up an account with Heroku, then follow these steps for deployment -
  - Create an app
  - Name the app
  - Connect the app to GitHub and find the repository.
  - Configure Variables - These are often the sensitive data variables that are needed to be kept secret from public sight. Head over to the settings tab and under the Config Vars sections, add the config vars appropriate to the app. In this case, it is ALLOWED_HOSTS, CLIENT_ORIGIN, CLOUDINARY_URL and DATABASE_URL, EMAIL_HOST_PASS, EMAIL_HOST_USER and SECRET_KEY. **Note: ALLOWED_HOSTS and CLIENT_ORIGIN will be almost identical. ALLOWED_HOSTS will be the url without `https://` and CLIENT_ORIGIN will have the full length url including `https://`, however excluding the final forward slash `/`**
    - ![Deployment Heroku](/documentation/deployment.webp)
  - Go to the Deploy tab and half way down the page you can choose to select automatic deploy (this is optional). When this is active, whenever a new edit is received by GitHub, Heroku also updates the application and builds a new deployment. I chose for this project not to automatically deploy with each `git push`. Click the deploy branch button at the bottom and await for completion. You will be alerted within the build console when the build and subsequent deployment is complete.

## [Testing](TESTING.md)
All testing and code validation is shown in the seperate [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Front-end Credits <a name="creds"></a>
The code for the frontend of this project was inspired by the fantastic walkthrough project conducted by the [CodeInstitute]((https://codeinstitute.net/de/)) Team. The frontend React app called *Moments* (link to which is found in the Code section below) was the perfect grounding for PhotoFootprint to build on. 

### Code <a name="code-fe"></a>
- Code Institute's [Moments](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) code was used throughout the set up of this project. It was the prefect starting point for PhotoFootprint. Many of the core CRUD functions of the frontend between Moments and PhotoFootprint aligned, along with styling and composition. I editted, customised and added different buttons and styling to fit the specific needs of PhotoFootprint. 
- Within the modal code, in order to fix bug #4 in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md), I needed to add the following code found on [this thread](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/issues/3480) - `<div onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}></div>`

## Backend Credits <a name="cred-be"></a>
PhotoFootprint was inspired and supported by the brilliant walkthrough project conducted by the Team at [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/de/). The API built in the *drf-api* walkthrough (linked below in **Code** section) was the perfect grounding for PhotoFootprint to set up from. 

### Code <a name="code-be"></a>
- Code Institute's [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) code was the basis for PhotoFootprint API. [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) was the perfect fit for what PhotoFootprint's goal was, so I editted, customised and added models and code to fit the specific needs of PhotoFootprint.

# Acknowledgements <a name="acknow"></a>
This has been a challenging but fun project, to have the support from Alex K, my mentor has been truly wonderful, I am blessed that we get on well as people as well as development colleagues. He would often bring a calming energy that would help me to see clearer in order to problem solve the bugs that were infront of us. My wife, Sabrina has been a saint throughout, giving me the support and occasional boost of confidence that I can achieve this task in the timeframe. I want to offer a huge thank you to Kay at Code Institute, alongwith Tutors Sean and the rest of the team, they've been brilliant in their support. Completing this Coding Course in 5 months shows me that I can code well, and learn quickly, both strong foundations for good quality developer. Code Institute taught me this, so a huge thank you to all the team at Code Institute, they've helped me to change my life direction towards a new career in development. 

# Overall Learning Outcomes <a name="outcomes"></a>
I have really enjoyed learning React over the past 6 weeks and to have this project at the end of it gives me a real boost in confidence and self belief, that there is so much possible and I am only at the tip of the tip of the iceberg of what React can create. I am excited to learn more and delve deeper into react material after this course has been completed.
