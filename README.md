# PhotoFootprint
## Introduction
PhotoFootprint is a photo based social media platform for travellers. It's core goal is to help bring awareness to Eco friendly methods of transportation, allowing the community to share their own experiences easily and simply on the application. User's can upload posts which can be liked, bookmarked (saved) and commented on. User's can follow other user's to stay upto date with their friends and favourite travellers.

# Overall Project Goals <a name="overall"></a>
PhotoFootprint's overall goal is to help bring awareness to Eco friendly methods of transportation, allowing the community to share their own experiences easily and simply on the application. User's can upload posts which can be liked, bookmarked (saved) and commented on. User's can follow other user's to stay upto date with their friends and favourite travellers. The application will have a fully CRUD functional API with frontend that serves the API JSON data in a user friendly manner.
# Frontend <a name="frontend"></a>
The frontend of this project is a React JS application. The following subsections are all of the Design, Features & Credits of the frontend part of this project.
## Design <a name="design"></a>
### Agile <a name="agile"></a>
I approached this project with an agile philosophy, applying the tools that GitHub offers to support this project. I set up a [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6), alongwith [Milestones](https://github.com/AlfredA93/pf-api/milestones) to help categorise the parts of the application that needed fulfilling. I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the User Stories and Tasks needed to be fulfilled. For the frontend I implemented User Stories which are referenced [below.](#user-stories)

### Project Goal <a name="project-fe"></a>
The goal within the frontend part of this project is to create a frontend React application that enables users to share content within a photobased social media platform. The platform should request and respond to the backend API handling the JSON data it receives which is then presented in a user friendly manner. Users can add/edit and/or delete posts, comments, likes, bookmarks. Users can create and edit their account. Users can also fill in a form to contact the PhotoFootprint Team through simple form.

### Scope <a name="scope-fe"></a>
Our scope for this project is small and aims to cover the basic functionality of what a social media application needs, this is due to having a short timeframe to meet the deadline for this project. The project would be further developed upon post-production. 

The whole project needed to be fulfilled within 19 days, therefore the API would need to be finished within 5-6 days (realistically), to allow more time spent on the frontend React app (8-9 days), allowing a minimum of 3-4 days for README documentation to be fulfilled at the end. We needed to be flexible with the needs of the project due to the set deadline, which was why I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the tasks set out in the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6). This meant that we had the core functionality of what we needed, but also allowed us to be flexible and address any bugs or errors if/when they arose.

### Structure <a name="structure-fe"></a>
React is based on components. So within the display view, many components can make up the whole. See the [Features](#features) section for screenshots of the below components in action.
- Navigation Bar - This will feature throughout the entire site, staying consistent for the user.
- Most Followed Accounts - Most Followed Accounts section will appear on every page (except the add/edit post page), below the navbar (on mobile/small screen devices) or to the right of the post(s) (on larger screens/desktops).
- Post (when in Discover, Feed and Profile pages) - Each post will appear displaying the Image, Title, Travel Type and Summary, alongwith the Like icon and count, Comment Icon and count and the Bookmark Icon to save the bookmark. It will not display the main content of the post. On the Feed and Discover pages, the page has an Infinite Scroll feature that means more posts can be loaded without pagination (only if there are more than 10 posts on a page)
- Post (once clicked into the post or clicking on the comment button) - Within the individual post page, the Post will now include the main content of the post, where the owner of the post can write more content for their post.
- Comments - The comments section only appears on the individual post page, where users can now interact with the post and share their views with the owner of the post publically. This has Infinite Scroll, which loads older comments as you scroll down (only if there are more than 10 comments on a post).
- Edit Post Dropdown - This dropdown menu will display on each post where there are current logged in user is the owner of the post on screen.
- Edit Profile Dropdown - This dropdown menu allows the user to edit the profile details (username, password & bio) only if the current logged in user is the owner of the profile in view.
- Contact Us - This component is a button which enables a Modal to appear on screen when clicked. This allows the user to contact the PhotoFootprint Team if there is any questions, queries or feedback about the website. This is shown only if the current logged in user is the owner of the profile in view.
- Add/Edit Post - This is a standalone page where users can add or edit their posts. The Edit post page will automatically fill the fields with the current post data to be editted, for each of use.

### Design Choices

#### Colors
- I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%2300A000&sub=1) to help with color palette design. With the standout colors listed below
  - #00A000 Green
  - #3F4A3C Dark Grey with Green Hint
  - #00A847 Green
  - #14648D Pastel Blue
  - #F6EDD9 Cream
  - #00A6F3 Deep Sky Blue

![ColorSpace](/documentation/frontend-imgs/design-colour.webp)

#### Typography

The font [*Assistant*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Assistant) from GoogleFonts felt like the front that best matched the ethos of the [Overall Project Goals](#overall).

## Credits <a name="creds"></a>
The code for the frontend of this project was inspired by the fantastic walkthrough project conducted by the [CodeInstitute]((https://codeinstitute.net/de/)) Team. The frontend React app called *Moments* (link to which is found in the Code section below) was the perfect grounding for PhotoFootprint to build on. 

### Code <a name="code-fe"></a>
- Code Institute's [Moments](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) code was used throughout the set up of this project. It was the prefect starting point for PhotoFootprint. Many of the core CRUD functions of the frontend between Moments and PhotoFootprint aligned, along with styling and composition. I editted, customised and added different buttons and styling to fit the specific needs of PhotoFootprint.

# Backend - PhotoFootprint API <a name="backend"></a>
The backend of this project is a Django REST API application. The following subsections are all of the Design, Features & Credits of the backend part of this project.
## Design (backend) <a name="design-be"></a>
### Agile (backend) <a name="agile-be"></a>
To manage the tasks and user stories on this project I used GitHub Projects. For the backend I wrote Milestones for each app, with issues (tasks) to be completed within each milestone, which could then be 'closed' when each was completed. Here is a link to the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6) and [PhotoFootprint Milestones](https://github.com/AlfredA93/pf-api/milestones)
- The picture below is during the API phase of completion, when the Front End User Stories were yet to be added to the Project.

### Project Goal (backend) <a name="goals-be"></a>
The goal of the backend API is to create a fully functional API which supplies data for a frontend react app. The admins will be able to post, update and delete posts/comments/likes/bookmarks and follows within the development environment of the API (when debug is set to True). Outside of the development environment, Users will be able to do the same from the frontend react app accessing the API which serves JSON data directly to the frontend.

### Scope (backend) <a name="scope-be"></a>
Our scope for this project is small and aims to cover the basic functionality of what a social media application needs, this is due to having a short timeframe to meet the deadline for this project. The project would be further developed upon post-production. 

The whole project needs to be fulfilled within 19 days, therefore the API would need to be finished within 5-6 days (realistically), to allow more time spent on the frontend React app (8-9 days), allowing a minimum of 3-4 days for README documentation to be fulfilled at the end. We needed to be flexible with the needs of the project due to the set deadline, which was why I applied labels of 'Could Have', 'Should Have' and 'Must Have' to give priority to the tasks set out in the [PhotoFootprint GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/AlfredA93/projects/6). This meant that we had the core functionality of what we needed, but also allowed us to be flexible and address any bugs or errors if/when they arose.

The API will have appropriate apps to fulfil the following tasks:
- CRUD functionality on Posts **(Must Have)**
- CRUD functionality on Comments **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Likes **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Followers **(Must Have)**
- Create, Read and Delete functionality on Bookmarks **(Should Have)**
- Create functionality on Contact Us form. **(Could Have)**


### Structure (backend) <a name="structure-be"></a>
The structure of the API needed to be organised, so we could make sure that all the relationships between the models could be mapped before coding. Below in the [ERD](#erd) section, you can see the relationships between the models with the arrows.

- Post Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - title - max length 100 characters
    - summary - max length 250 characters
    - content - text field
    - image - image field, default post image if user doesn't add image
    - travel - choice of 9 travels types: bicycle, boat, by foot, car, electric car, multiple, other, plane, train
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field
- Profile Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field
    - name - max length 250 characters
    - bio - text field
    - image - image field, default post image if user doesn't add image
- Comment Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - post (Foreign Key - from Post Model)
    - content - text field
    - created_at - datetime field
    - updated_at - datetime field
- Like Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - post (Foreign Key - from Post Model)
    - created_at - datetime field
- Follower Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model, related_name='following')
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model, related_name='followed')
    - created_at - datetime field
- Bookmark Model
    - owner (Foreign Key - from User model)
    - post (Foreign Key - from Post Model)
    - created_at - datetime field
- Message Model
    - name - char field, max length 120 characters
    - email - email field
    - subject - char field, max length 120 characters
    - message - text field
    - created_at - datetime field

Filters - We need filters for the following:
- Posts filtered by bookmark and bookmark owner (for saved page)
- Posts filtered by title, travel, content and owner (for search bar)
- Posts filtered by owner (for profile page)
- Posts filtered by following (for feed page)

#### ERD <a name="erd"></a>
![Model Image](documentation/backend-imgs/erd.webp)

## Features
The API's main features within this app are CRUD based. ie. Create, Read, Update and Destroy.
### Future Features
- Add a maps app and map model for setting post coordinates, so that users can store their journey's and share them on each post.
- Enable video and larger files to be uploaded.

## Credits <a name="cred-be"></a>
PhotoFootprint was inspired and supported by the brilliant walkthrough project conducted by the Team at [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/de/). The API built in the *drf-api* walkthrough (linked below in **Code** section) was the perfect grounding for PhotoFootprint to set up from. 

### Code <a name="code-be"></a>
- Code Institute's [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) code was the basis for PhotoFootprint API. [drf-api](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api) was the perfect fit for what PhotoFootprint's goal was, so I editted, customised and added models and code to fit the specific needs of PhotoFootprint.

## Deployment <a name="deploy"></a>

This project was deployed to Heroku. To prepare the backend for this we need to do the following.
- Create a `Procfile` at the top most directory of the code - this will be used my Heroku command line to know what to do with the code once the application is built. In this file the code below should be written on seperate lines
  - `release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
  - `web: gunicorn photofootapi.wsgi`
- Create a `requirements.txt` file. The easiest way to do this is once your code is ready for deployment type in the command when under the root directory `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and all the Python libraries will be added to the requirements.txt file, ready for Heroku to install all the dependancies.
- Create a runtime.txt file - This is used by Heroku to determine which version of Python to use to run the libraries within your application. Check the heroku support documentation to see which Python versions are still supported [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#specifying-a-python-version). I chose this version - `python-3.11.5`
- Build a production ready application in the IDE before deployment, so Heroku can deploy this will greater ease. Under the root directory, add a new `staticfiles` folder. Making sure to keep it case sensitive to `staticfiles`. Once this has been done. Type in the command `python manage.py collectstatic`. This will compile all the static files from the backend to the staticfolder. Now change directory into the frontend folder - `cd frontend` and type this code `npm run build && mv build ../staticfiles/.` This will build the react application and place all the necessary build files into a build folder and then move it into the staticfiles folder we previously created. If you need to make any future changes post deployment, use this following command to make changes to the latest build - `npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.` 
- **Before deploying your production ready application you must set DEBUG = False within your IDE, so the site works as intended with any 404 pages working correctly. Once this change has been made, you can `push` the changes to your GitHub Repository** 
- Set up an account with Heroku, then follow these steps for deployment -
  - Create an app
  - Name the app
  - Connect the app to GitHub and find the repository.
  - Configure Variables - These are often the sensitive data variables that are needed to be kept secret from public sight. Head over to the settings tab and under the Config Vars sections, add the config vars appropriate to the app. In this case, it is ALLOWED_HOSTS, CLIENT_ORIGIN, CLOUDINARY_URL and DATABASE_URL, EMAIL_HOST_PASS, EMAIL_HOST_USER and SECRET_KEY. **Note: ALLOWED_HOSTS and CLIENT_ORIGIN will be almost identical. ALLOWED_HOSTS will be the url without `https://` and CLIENT_ORIGIN will have the full length url including `https://`, however excluding the final forward slash `/`**

  - Go to the Deploy tab and half way down the page you can choose to select automatic deploy (this is optional). When this is active, whenever a new edit is received by GitHub, Heroku also updates the application and builds a new deployment. I chose for this project not to automatically deploy with each `git push`. Click the deploy branch button at the bottom and await for completion. You will be alerted within the build console when the build and subsequent deployment is complete.
